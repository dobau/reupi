Actually the best way I found to solve this in windows for Ruby itself, not just one gem, is to do the following:

Download http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem into c:\railsinstaller\cacert.pem. Make sure you save it as a .pem file, rather than a text file.
Go to your Computer -> Advanced Settings -> Environment Variables
Create a new System Variable:

Variable: SSL_CERT_FILE Value: C:\RailsInstaller\cacert.pem

Close all your command prompts, including your Rails server command prompt, etc.

Start a new ruby irb prompt, and try the following:

$irb>require 'open-uri'
$irb>open('https://www.gmail.com')
It should all work now just fine.
